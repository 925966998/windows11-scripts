rem # AdditionalCriticalWorkerThreads value increases the number of critical worker threads created for a specified work queue

rem # By increasing the value of this one, you can get more additional worker threads which will allow for more queued I/O in the storage subsystem

rem # Allow more I/O to queue in the storage subsystem

rem # Value is determined by RAM size NOT thread or core count
